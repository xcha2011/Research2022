However, wavelength-dependent light attenuation and back-scattering result in color distortion and haze effect, which degrade the visibility of images. To address this problem, firstly, we want to propose an unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating realistic underwater images (color distortion and haze effect) from in-air image and depth map pairs based on improved underwater imaging model. Secondly, we want to adopt for color restoration and dehazing.","Generative Adversarial Network, underwater scene, deep learning, robot.	",Hard work with 10 hours per week. Ability to learn,,126

Using a scaled low-energy electron beam, UMER cleverly accesses the intense, high-brightness, regime of beam operation in accelerators, at a much lower cost than larger and more energetic machines. UMER is therefore an ideal test-bed to understand the brightness limitations of existing and future accelerators. Examples of such applications include high-luminosity colliders, spallation neutron sources and X-ray free electron lasers and related intense light sources, high-average-power free electron lasers, and future heavy ion-driven inertial fusion concepts.

"Bensi, Michelle",ENGR,Civil and Environmental Engineering,mbensi@umd.edu,Designing and Planning for Resilience and Sustainability: Synergies and Trade-offs,"You may have heard the terms ‘resilience’ and ‘sustainability’ discussed in your classes or in the news. But do you know what these terms mean and how do they relate to one another? Are you interested in learning about and researching these important (and complex) concepts? Resilience is the ability of a system to react and adapt to abrupt shocks (internal and external) and avoid gradually occurring stressors. Efforts to build system resilience focus on preparation for, mitigation of, and response to events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, and floods. It also considers how systems need to adapt as these hazards change over time. Sustainability focuses on the ability of a system to meet present and future needs. Sustainability is a characteristic of a dynamic, evolving system. Long-term sustainability will result not from movement along a smooth trajectory, but rather from continuous adaptation to changing conditions. While these two concepts are related, they are not the same. Design and planning for resilience can lead to synergies/co-benefits that help to bolster sustainability. This is because co-benefits of resilience planning often result in benefits that accrue daily, which may contribute to long-term sustainability. However, efforts to increase resilience may also be associated with trade-offs that reduce sustainability. This project will focus on resilience planning for built infrastructure systems that are designed to serve social and economic functions. There needs to be a deeper understanding of how communities evaluate (1) whether resilience planning efforts complement other community-level objectives, (2) whether there exist potential tradeoffs between investing in resilience and other objectives. Yet, the challenge is that communities facing natural hazards/extreme weather events are typically concerned with other risks, including, but not limited to sea-level rise, resource depletion, and pandemics. Thus, community resilience planning occurs in the context of multiple, potentially competing, sometimes complementary objectives, such as adaptation, sustainability, and public health. This project will assess academic research and current codes/standards that consider resilience and sustainability planning. We will identify and catalogue input, process, output, and outcome indicators related to resilience and sustainability. We will examine case studies for resilience planning in infrastructure systems that offer sustainability co-benefits.","Adaptation, co-benefits, mitigation, risk assessment, sustainability, resilience planning",Experience or (interest in building experience in): (1) reading about and summarizing existing research and practice and (2) working with and analyzing data,,204
"Bensi, Michelle",ENGR,Civil and Environmental Engineering,somayeh@terpmail.umd.edu,Prediction of extreme floods,"Flood events have significant impacts on communities and society in general. In addition to posing a danger to human health and safety, flood events can have significant economic implications. Flood damage can be caused by coastal flooding from hurricane storm surge, river flooding, urban flooding, flash floods, and more. Inland flooding events have led to an average of over $4.5 billion/year since 1990 while tropical cyclones (e.g., hurricanes) have led to an average of over $30 billion/year in damages from flooding and wind. The frequency and cost of these events continues to increase as a result of climate change as well as changes in land use. In order to reduce the negative consequences of flooding, we need to have realistic estimates of the probability of experiencing flood events as well as models for predicting the severity of floods. These mechanisms can occur individually but can (and often do) occur in combination. Traditional probabilistic flood hazard assessment (PFHA) approaches usually focus on a single flood mechanism, which is not sufficient in most cases and will generally lead to underestimation of flood hazards. However, consideration of more than one flood mechanism in the analysis introduces new challenges. These challenges include understanding and characterizing the dependence between flood mechanisms and developing models to simulate the interaction between involved flood mechanisms. Student researchers supporting this project will help to develop novel methods for prediction of flood hazards caused by multi-mechanism floods. Students will use statistical and machine learning methods to develop these models.","Flooding, machine learning, statistics, natural hazards, coding, data, visualization, precipitation, hurricane","Interests in statistics/machine learning and natural hazards.

"Borgia, Gerald",CMNS,Biology,borgia@umd.edu,Mate choice and sexual selection in bowerbirds,"We are studying mate choice in bowerbirds. Male bowerbirds have a unique and elaborate kind of sexual display seen in no other animal in which males build a stick structure on their display court on the ground decorated with bright collected items . Females enter the bower for courtship where they can observe the displaying male and the decorations he collects. Bowerbirds offer a key model system for understanding sexual selection theory. We have taped the behavior of males and females in 13 species, but most focus has been on Australian satin bowerbirds which have we have intensively monitored with video cameras for 16 years at their mating sites. The questions we are addressing are factors affecting male mating success including the role of the bower, decorations,male focal and dancing display, dispersion of display sites, and physical characteristics of males including age and brain size. Volunteer students often start scoring behavior on video tapes and may then move onto working on their own project gathering and analyzing to address a particular question.

In the United States, where employees have limited access to paid family leave, women have been disproportionately impacted by school closures and daycare disruptions. In September alone, over 800,000 women decided to leave the workforce. The decision to leave the workforce is often framed as a personal choice; however, for many, a lack of familial, government, or societal support in the form of paid leave and childcare make remaining in the workforce impossible for many women. In this research, we seek to uncover how working mothers define their professional identities and make decisions around workforce participation.

The purpose of our study is to document the process of transitioning from an in-person 1:1 tutoring experience as part of teacher preparation for students in their junior year to virtual 1:1 tutoring using a mixed-method design with both quantitative data from reading assessments and surveys and qualitative data from focus groups. We will document in detail how pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) knowledge, confidence, and teaching fidelity change over the course of the 9-week tutoring experience. In addition, we will conduct focus groups with the PSTs at the end of the semester and evaluate the progress their tutee made in early reading skills. 
The special education tutoring program was initiated in 2016 as a way for junior PSTs to have hands on experience in conducting reading assessments, using the information from those assessments to plan intervention, and deliver reading instruction for one hour per day for nine weeks. Students have anecdotally reported that the experience has better prepared them for the internship year, helped them determine if special education was the right field for them, and increased their understanding of effective reading instruction. But until now, there has been no formal evaluation of the program or its potential benefit.

"Dennis, Rachel",AGNR,Animal and Avian Sciences,rldennis@umd.edu,Effects of Light Spectrum on the Neural Development and Behavior of Chickens,"Chickens are commonly maintained in indoor rearing facilities with artificial lighting, limited to the visible light spectrum. Unlike humans, birds have tetrachromatic vision and the ability to see in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, especially in the UV-A spectrum, which is the subset of UV closest to visible light. The artificial light provided in animal housing facilities generally provides no source of UV light. Elimination of vital light spectrum may impede the growth and development of neural links, especially those eminating from the visual centers of the central nervous system. Insufficient lighting spectrum can also impact the birds’ ability to discriminate based on their color spectrum, hindering their ability to discriminate between objects and individuals in their environment, including the ability to determine feed from non-feed. The exposure or elimination of specific wavelengths of light can alter bird behaviors, including feeding and social behaviors (Prayitno et al., 1997). Near UV-A spectrum of light (345-400nm) has been shown to enhance birds’ visual discrimination of feed components (Rajchard, 2009). When provided with a choice, wild birds spend the majority of their time in habitats that provide UV-A light (Ross et al., 2013), increasing their chances of obtaining food and other resources in that habitat. Chicks reared with exposure to UV-A light at an early age, showed improved skeletal health later in life (Bernard et al., 1989), suggesting an important role for UV exposure during development. This experiment will determine the ideal lighting spectrum and intensity, as well as timing, to provide for chickens in a research housing facility to improve well-being, enrich social behavioral repertoire and improve feeding behaviors.","UV light, chicken, animal behavior, neural development, light, UV exposure, Dennis",Basic understanding of anatomy and physiology.

Doing so is part of a larger project to consider the labor of healthcare--those who made medicines, provided care, assisted in childbirth, among others--across different spaces of the early modern world. This work is especially important today given the attention to frontline workers and the recognition that they are not compensated commensurate with their risk. Additionally, this work helps reconstruct the healthways of early modern Barbados, an island quite significant in the histories of colonialism, slavery, and race. To do this work, the researcher will be engaged in reading advertisements from The Barbados Mercury, the island's principal newspaper from the period, to identify instances of medical-related sales and other healthcare notices.

"Fuge, Mark",ENGR,Mechanical Engineering,jwang38@umd.edu,Automated Custom-Mesh Generation for Finite Element Simulations,"This project aims to tackle the generation of quality meshes to meet the requirements of finite element (FE) simulations for multi-physics. Rather than using the in-built mesh generators (which can hardly customize the attributes of mesh) in FEA packages, we want to build a mesh generator to realize the customization of meshes for FE simulations. While mesh generation is a huge research topic that can lead to very broad and deep studies-e.g., 2D (rectangular, triangular or hybrid) or 3D (tetrahedral, hexahedral or hybrid) meshing, structured, unstructured or adaptive meshing, mechanical, fluidic or thermal simulation-this project starts with structured triangular mesh generation on primitive 2D geometries (i.e., polygons). The specific goal is to 1) automate the generation of such mesh no matter what polygons are given and how they are combined, and 2) customize the mesh element size. The generated 2D mesh needs to be compatible with the FEA solver (FEnics Project) for a fluidic simulation. For a quick start, candidates will take advantage of an existing mesh generator GMSH. The project can be built up based on GMSH plus a knowledge of Python language. Candidates are not required to build up everything from foundation. However, this project is quite open and extensible. Candidates are welcome to use their own approaches, algorithms or codes to accomplish the mission or even extend the project to more diverse problems (e.g., 3D mesh generation, structured 3D mesh generation, and multi-physics simulation). If successful, the project can lead to potential paper publication (co-author or first author) or be used as a final project.

"Khurana, Archana",CMNS,Department of Mathematics,akhurana@umd.edu,Solving transportation and transhipment problems with restricted and enhanced flow,"The transportation model, a sub class of linear programming problem, considers minimum-cost planning problems for shipping a product from some origins to other destinations, such as from factories to warehouses, or from warehouses to supermarkets, with the shipping cost from one location to another being a linear function of the number of units shipped. The amount to be sent from each origin, the amount to be received at each destination, and the cost per unit shipped from any origin to any destination are specified. In transportation problems, transhipment is not considered, that is, each point acts as shipper only or as a receiver only. We can extend this problem to permit transhipment with the additional feature that shipments may go via any sequence of points rather than being restricted to direct connections from one origin to one of the destination which would reduce the cost of transportation. Both the transportation problem and the transhipment problem are also quite widely used for planning bulk distribution, especially in the USA where the (road) distances travelled are large. Transportation problem deals with distributing any commodity from any group of 'sources' to any group of destinations or 'sinks' in the most cost effective way with a given 'supply' and 'demand' constraints. There always exists an optimal solution to the balanced transportation problem. In case of unbalanced transportation problem, the total availability is not equal of total demand, thus some of the source and/or destination constraints are satisfied as inequalities. For example, sometimes, one wishes to keep reserve stocks at the sources for emergencies thereby restricting the total transportation flow to a known specified level, it results in a transportation problem with impaired flow. For example, stockiest reserves the goods viz. medicines, food grains and other items at warehouses for emergencies. At this point of situation, some of the warehouses are forced to be closed down or are made to operate below their original operational level, while some still continue to maintain their original supplying behaviour which gives rise to transportation problem with restricted flow. Again sometimes, situations may arise when because of the extra demand in the market due to high storage cost at some sources or during festive /marriage seasons or during fire / military services, the total flow needs to be enhanced compelling some of the factories to increase their productions in order to meet this extra demand. This results in a transportation problem with enhanced flow. The optimal solution of such problems is of practical interest to the decision maker. Moreover in literature, much effort has been concentrated on two-dimensional transportation problems as well as transhipment problems with equality constraints.

Studies have shown a 93% occurrence rate following abdominal surgery and complications such as small bowel obstruction, chronic pelvic pain, and female infertility, where treatment accounts for over $1 billion in healthcare costs. Clinically adopted prevention strategies include a hyaluronic acid-carboxymethylcellulose sheet-like film often described as “brittle” and “sticky” in practice, while hydrogels face application difficulties and are heavily reliant upon a lubrication mechanism. Materials capable of anti-inflammatory or hemostat delivery have garnered recent attention, but still face issue in time-effective dosing without deleterious side effects. Inclusion of a targeted therapeutic into a tissue adherent, flexible solid barrier host matrix with a facile application method would provide for a holistic approach to adhesions prevention. Adherence and conformability to tissue is imperative in design of implanted biomaterials. Research in adhesions prevention has successfully developed materials that overcame these challenges and facilitated treatment largely through physical means, but neglected emphasis on biologically derived approaches. The objective of this work is to design a material capable of reducing adhesions severity in both physical and immunological facets through effective therapeutic release from a polymer solid barrier with pertinent degradation behavior.","surgery, biomaterials, polymers, adhesions","Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering, Materials Science or Chemistry background required",fml.umd.edu,156

Kuo My proposed exhibition will focus on the ink paintings and films of Gao Xingjian who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2000 and was the first and only Chinese writer to receive the prize. Gao is a naturalized French citizen and lives in Paris. His self-exile is in part due to the censoring of his work by the Chinese government. Although critics often cite his novels and short stories as the main justification for his Nobel prize, he has also excelled in writing and directing plays, directing films, and making ink paintings. Gao’s style of ink painting belongs to the great Chinese literati tradition of xieyi (literally “writing the idea”); this style allows him to create subtle, intuitive settings and characters that move in the limits between figurative and abstract art, in a way that has been done by many of the great masters in Chinese art history. His paintings explore the expressive possibilities of ink and washes; the nuanced light and dark shadings, subtle washes, textures, and volumes in his paintings are both dramatic and refreshing. His films are hard to classify but, generally speaking, are more akin to what can be called “essay films” and “cine-poems” and can be studied in conjunction with not only his ink paintings but also his novels, short stories, and plays. The aim of the exhibition and the accompanying book is to explore the extent to which Gao’s paintings and films can be seen as exemplary reconciliation and synthesis of Chinese and Euro-American aesthetics. Theoretical issues to be explored will include beauty, diaspora, transnationalism, and global aesthetics. The exhibition is tentatively scheduled for November and December of 2013; screenings of two of Gao’s films, Shadows/ Silhouettes and After the Flood/Après le Deluge will be held during the exhibitions. Gao is making his third film; if it is finished by the time the proposed exhibition opens in November 2013, it is likely we can also screen it. In addition, lectures and other educational and public programs will be included. The National Gallery in Prague, Czech Republic, has expressed a very strong interest in taking the show in 2014-15. The proposed project on the paintings and films of Gao Xingjian is concerned with inter-disciplinary and inter-media issues and will therefore enhance the public’s understanding of contemporary Chinese art in an increasingly global world. The proposed exhibition and the publication of the accompanying book will certainly enhance the national and international visibility of the research and teaching of art history, film studies, and Chinese studies at the University of Maryland.","exile, diaspora, art, China, Kuo, ARHU, Chinese art, art history, Kuo","writing skills, research skills, patience",,23

How fast electrons move when current flows in the semiconductor depends on many factors. A good analogy to the experiment: suppose you're standing by is still the river and cannot tell how fast river is flowing. You dump a bottle of ink in the river and run downstream a fixed distance and measured the time it takes for the cloud of ink to appear. So you know the velocity. From the size of the cloud you also can learn about the diffusion of ink in the water. This is very similar to the Haynes Shockley experiment except the distances are in millimeters, the times are in the microsecond range, and something other than ink is used as the marker.

I study Corydoras catfish, which use tactile interactions (touch) to communicate with each other. You might not think of catfish as an obvious research model for social interaction, but the simplicity of these behaviors make it easier quantify and analyze these social interactions. My research uses these tactile interactions (which I termed nudges) to study how individual Corydoras catfish can actively coordinate within a group, how active social interactions might be involved with social learning, and how these behaviors might vary between Corydoras species.

Research assistants working on this project will:
•	care for live fish in the lab
•	run experiments by placing fish in social situations
•	analyze video of experiments

Students who are successful in this role may have opportunities to conduct their own experiments in the future.  Interested students may be at any stage of their degree, all training will be provided.  Experience caring for fish (or other animals) is preferred.

"Rockler, Amanda",AGNR,Extension,arockler@umd.edu,"Building a Healthy Bay thru Meaningful Community Engagement. 
This project will leverage innovative research and community partnerships from an existing NSF-funded project entitled “Stormwater Management Across Urban Ecosystems: Diagnostic Tools and Community Engagement For Ecological Restoration, Equitable Community Development, and Revitalization”. ","The protection of water quantity and quality is of fundamental importance to Chesapeake Bay’s restoration goals. Implementing small-scale stormwater best management practices (BMPs) across urban landscapes e.g., rain barrels, rain gardens, conservation landscaping) is essential to achieve these goals and meet the Total Daily Maximum Loads (TMDLs) of target pollutants. The implementation of urban stormwater BMPs is a significant challenge given that most urban stormwater is exported from landscapes partitioned into thousands of individually-owned parcels. Widespread and sustained community-based engagement is essential to the implementation of sufficient numbers of BMPs needed to meet Chesapeake Bay’s TMDL targets by 2025. Despite decades of research, urban residents’ knowledge of water resources and the influence of their activities on watershed health remains poor. We need to develop and implement novel approaches to not only improve resident knowledge and attitudes to water resources and stormwater management, but to also develop effective outreach programs that in the long term can foster sustainable behavior change. This is especially important in low-income neighborhoods with historically underserved minority populations that often disproportionately bear greater negative impacts of poor watershed health, including little quality greenspace, degraded stormwater infrastructure, flooding, and pollution. Partnering with low-income and minority urban communities on water resources and stormwater management is vital to not only achieve Chesapeake Bay’s restoration goals, but assist with environmental justice efforts across the watershed.","stormwater, green infrastructure, behavior, social science, ecosystem health, environmental science, mosquitos, health, environmental justice, outreach, interdisciplinary research",Interest in social and natural sciences.

They draw on information gleaned about individuals from the different social contexts of the web, in ways that violate users’ privacy according to the theory of contextual-integrity. To measure this violation, we offer a context-sensitive empirical study of the usage of persistent-identifiers by third-party trackers. We applied an instrumented FireFox browser and launched six browsing experiments across three social contexts: news, health, education. We ask how social contexts of websites explain persistent identification? And should we expect trackers from certain contexts to become more likely to link user identities across contexts? Our findings show that social contexts matter. Third of the observed third-parties had persistently identified users among social contexts. This is happening in all three contexts, between every pair of websites. Trackers from the healthcare context are the most likely ones to link user identifiers across contexts. This contrasts previous findings that labeled healthcare websites as less risky for privacy. While tracking within sites might be marginal, the tendency of trackers to persistently identify users across social contexts is alarming. This is a modest step to apply contextual understanding to online tracking, revealing unaccounted privacy violations.","Privacy, online tracking, third party trackers, online advertising, contextual integrity","Data analysis and data visualization, preferably in R",,192

Ongoing research has enhanced our understanding of flame spread dynamics through an extensive study of flames spreading upwards over commonly used polymers. Using highly spatially resolved measurements of flame to surface heat flux and material burning rate at the critical length scale of interest, an analytical expression was developed that describes the heat feedback of flames burning in this configuration. This expression has since been coupled with a powerful solid phase pyrolysis solver, ThermaKin, to enable simulations of flame spread dynamics with a reasonable computational cost and accuracy beyond that of current models. We are looking for two students to help advance this project by improving the capabilities and ease of use of this flame spread model and by examining the potential of a new technique for measuring flame heat flux.

Compared to other racial groups, Asian American youth report the highest level of peer racial discrimination (Juang, Atkin, & Yoo, 2017) yet they are often unprepared when they encounter racial injustice. During COVID-19, Asian American youth and parents are experiencing unprecedented level of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. As President Trump labels it the “Chinese virus” and “Kung-Flu”, there is a surge of racism and xenophobia towards Chinese/Asian Americans (both adults and youth), ranging from name calling, social exclusion to physical assault/violence, resulting in high levels of stress for Asian American families (Litman, 2020 ; Tessler, Choi, & Kao, 2020). Parents play a crucial role in preparing children for possible experiences of societal racism, stereotypes, and discrimination, promoting wariness and/or trust of other ethnic groups, and fostering knowledge and appreciation for youth’s cultural heritage (Grindal & Nieri, 2015; Hughes et al., 2006). Although many ethnic-racial socialization (ERS) practices have been linked to positive youth psychological and academic outcomes, preparation for bias messages are infrequently conveyed to Asian immigrant children (Priest et al., 2014). Currently, little is known about the ways that Asian American parents subtly embed messages about race and ethnicity in cultural practices and daily routines (Hughes et al., 2006) and what this process looks for Asian American children. This study utilized semi-structured interviews to explore how Asian American parents talk to their children about race, ethnicity, and bullying/discrimiation during COVID-19.","ethnic racial socialization, Chinese American children, bullying, parenting",Able to read and communicate in Chinese,https://education.umd.edu/research-college/labs/bullying-prevention-and-mental-health-promotion-lab,137

The Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) USA training teaches adults to recognize signs of youth mental illness and intervene using a five-step action plan that focuses on assessing for risk, listening nonjudgmentally, and connecting youth to resources and mental health care. The present study examines the effects of YMHFA training on parents’ mental health literacy; mental health first aid intentions, actual behaviors to help youth, and confidence in helping skills; attitudes toward seeking professional help; and stigma.

Organic matter is a dynamic component of soils that is responsible for many of the desirable properties that enable soils to produce food, wildlife habitat and protect watersheds, including the Chesapeake Bay. The nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus are essential for all plants, but are also the most widespread form of water pollutants. The nutrient sulfur is being depleted from many soils, but is critical to form amino acids essential for usable proteins in human diets. The element carbon is the main constituent of soil organic matter and key to soil health and climate change mitigation. Our lab is focused on balancing nutrient cycles, optimizing hydrology, sequestering carbon in soils to mitigate climate change, and developing practices for improving soil and environmental health. We are also working with environmental groups and grass roots farming organizations to develop more effective strategies for transitioning conventional grain farms to certified organic grain production. Student interns will assist with gathering field soil, plant, and water samples from various sites around Maryland, preparing them for analysis, conducting lab analyses and conducting statistical analyses and presenting the results to end users and the public.","soil, soil ecology, environment, farming, water quality, nutrients, sustainable, agriculture, cover crops, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, food nutrient density, greenhouse gases, carbon","working knowledge of MS Excel, MS WORD, at least one lab course in chemistry, conscientious and meticulous in work ethic, ability to work outdoors in any weather, intellectual curiosity, interest in sustainable agriculture and/or natural ecosystems.",https://agnr.umd.edu/about/directory/ray-weil,22
"Whitehead, Tony",BSOS,Anthropology,tonywhitehead1122@gmail.com,Tony’s End Of Life (TELP) Anthropology of Blackness (AOB) Professional Development Seminar/Writing Workshops,"When Professor Emeritus, Tony Whitehead fully retired from UMD’s Anthropology Department in 2017, he was eager to begin writing a memoir covering his life journey from a family of “Negro” sharecroppers in Nat Turner Country (Southampton County, Virginia) to an enjoyable 50 year career as a global health anthropologist/ ethnographer. This memoir was to include excerpts from his many writings produced over that career, but also from new essays reflecting on the first 23 years of his life, as well as on the four years since retiring. Advancing age and declining health over the past two years, resulted in him renaming his project the TELP, and to not only focus on his writings, but also to develop methods to involve interested younger scholars, including students, in this work. Having begun the first 21 years of his life in the segregated US South, followed by graduate school and a career focused on the study of the peoples, communities, and cultural systems of the Black World (African Diaspora), he is continuing his writings under the umbrella title of the Anthropology of Blackness (AOB). The TELP was planned as a seven year (2019-25), with several Long Term Objectives (LTOs), including: (1) To produce life journey auto-ethnographic essays, and monographs of collection of essays, as possible; (2) To establish AOD Research and Writing Teams (ARWTs) with a focus on completing as many of the planned Essays/Monographs as possible;”(3) To create an AOD Seminar/Writing Workshop Series (ASWWS) to share this work orally, and to recruit ARWT informants, essay co-authors, and monograph co-editors, and get them acclimated into specific writing topics; and (4) To establish an AOD Mentoring Program (TMP) for young Black Americans (BAs) and persons of other ethnicities and professions, who are pursuing careers in anthropology, and other disciplines and professions that emphasize writing and other methods of communicating. The professional development outcomes for students who volunteer to join me in this endeavor are the following: (1) developing team research and writing skills; (2) exposure to a broad number of professionals also interested in different AOB topics, as well as possible professional networking opportunities; and (3) depending on the interest and motivation of the student, the opportunity to become a co-author of one or more AOD essays, which could be beneficial in graduate school applications or employment opportunities.","Anthropology, Ethnography, Blackness, Writing","Writing and Editing, Website Maintenance (or willing to learn), Self-Motivation, Employment Responsible (engagement, communicating, timely submitting work, etc).",http://tony-whitehead.squarespace.com/,78
"Wild, Thomas",CMNS,Earth System Science Interdisciplinary C,twild@umd.edu,Decision-Driven Advances in Integrated Assessment Modeling of the Food-Energy-Water Nexus,"The student will join an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional research team developing innovative approaches to integrated planning of food-energy-water (FEW) systems in the context of major international sustainability challenges in Argentina and Uruguay. Benefiting from robust relationships with stakeholders, this research will sit at the exciting and consequential interface between science and decision-making. The postdoc will work under the direct supervision of Dr. Thomas Wild (http://blog.umd.edu/wildgroup/), Assistant Research Professor at the Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center, with co-advising from an experienced UMD team with diverse expertise, including Dr. Leon Clarke, Dr. Fernando Miralles-Wilhelm, and Dr. Mohamad Hejazi. As part of a large multi-institutional project, the student will also join a cohesive research team that includes collaborating researchers from Tufts University and Arizona State University. Some of the most important challenges that society faces, such as climate change and sustainable development more broadly, are strongly shaped by food-energy-water (FEW) system decisions made at the scale of river basins and sub-basins. However, regional FEW system planning is also shaped by national and global dynamics, such as climatic and socioeconomic change. The student will contribute to developing a novel computer modeling platform that can effectively couple sub-regional FEW resource and infrastructure systems together at the regional level and connect them to national and global socioeconomic and climatic forces to allow for comprehensive scenario exploration and uncertainty analysis. The student will contribute to work with stakeholders in Argentina and Uruguay to co-develop these decision-relevant modeling advances.

"Worsnop, Alec",PLCY,School of Public Policy,aworsnop@umd.edu,Insurgent Civil-Military Relations,"While the military plays a core role in defending a state from outside attack, it also has the coercive power to impose its will on the civilians it is meant to protect. As a result, much discussion of conventional militaries focuses on the need for civil-military relations that put civilians in control while insulating the military from politics. Yet, in the context of civil wars—such as those that have wracked Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, or Vietnam—successful insurgent groups often have highly integrated civil and military command structures. For example, a People’s Liberation Armed Forces (PLAF, also known as the Viet Cong) memo demonstrated the premium the organization put on this integration: “Revolutionary policy and military policy are interrelated— they are like lips and teeth.” 

Despite the centrality of balancing political and combat objectives, there is little research into the form and implications of the civil-military balance within rebel organizations. Planning how to counter and negotiate with violent non-state actors requires understanding how they approach the integrated tasks of war-fighting and state-building. 

To fill this gap, this project is working to construct a database measuring a range of civil-military characteristics in insurgent groups. We are currently collecting data on organizations since 1989.This project will draw on primary documents, historiographies, and contemporary press coverage to identify the breakdown of responsibilities and institutions that balance power and decision- making between specialists in violence and state-building. The primary responsibilities of a researcher will be collecting information and coding the civil-military balance of a range of insurgent groups.

Please provide a brief description (less than 1 page, single spaced) of the steps you would take to solve these problems. Be creative, and feel free to use any resources to develop your answers!

    1. The boundaries of countries and their provinces/states are not as straightforward as you might think – some boundaries are more accurate than others, and the names of regions can change between governing bodies. Given two sets of country boundaries from different sources, how would you use GIS to determine which countries are actually the same, and which ones are different?
    2. The Cropland Data Layer (CDL) developed by the USDA (see: https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/ ) is a high-quality map showing where different types of crops are grown each year. Each pixel value corresponds to the name of a crop type. How would you combine different crop types to make a map of broader categories? For example, grains crops vs. tree crops?

"Humber, Michael",BSOS,Department of Geographical Sciences,mmitkish@umd.edu,Analysis of Agricultural Supply Chains,"This project will develop an unprecedented geospatial analytical system and provide analysis of targeted production export countries, monitor countries that are major importers of grains, to understand their domestic production and take the satellite-based information into new territory, by linking it to real-time economic data and models, trade and price indicators, logistics data, and policy information to evaluate the implications on global food supply, markets and trade and to assess evolving trends and shocks. The provision of comprehensive, timely and transparent information on food supplies and market factors is critical for calming and reassuring markets as well as for highlighting where the issues are so that they can be addressed by international market actors. The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest episode highlighting the need for a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary food supply chain system. The proposed project is a significant step towards fulfilling the need for such a multi-disciplinary, real time system that will meet both the current and longer term information needs for assessing vulnerabilities and strengths of the rapidly evolving food supply chain","geography
